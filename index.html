				<h2>ðŸ“· Photo</h2>
				<p>
					Always with a camera in hand, I have been passionate about photography for a long time. In addition to its creative aspect, this art is for me an opportunity to discover new places, to share good moments and finally to keep memories of what I hold dear such as my family, my friends or my travels.

				<h2>ðŸ’» Communication</h2>
				<p>
					Communication is a field that I had the opportunity to discover a few years ago thanks to an internship in a company. This internship having particularly pleased me, I kept this idea in mind until my arrival at IESEG, where my wishes were only confirmed. Meticulous, organized and attentive to others, I like to create new supports to put forward all kinds of projects and learn new techniques in this sector.

				<h2>ðŸ‘Ÿ Fashion</h2>
				<p>
					Taken since little in the stores with my grandmother, fashion became, year after year, a hobby of which I would like to make my future career. To me, fashion is a way to express my personality, to develop my open-mindness each a little more and to involve my sense of aesthetics.
